# Recommender-System---Spotify-API
This project has the intent of recommending new songs using recommender system techniques and my iTunes Library as a reference database. This will allows to determine the top genres, songs, and artist that I like.

# Objective:
* Create a recommder system capable of making relevant recommendation
* Discover new songs using this tool.

# Dataset Description:
The dataset used to generate recommendations comes from an XML file exported from iTunes' Desktop Application. This XML file was transformed and clean as a first step and later uploaded to a database.
